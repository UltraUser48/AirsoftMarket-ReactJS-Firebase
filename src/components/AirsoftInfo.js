               Airsoft is a competitive team shooting sport in which participants eliminate opposing players with spherical plastic projectiles launched via replica air weapons called airsoft guns.

Although very similar to paintball in concept and gameplay, airsoft pellets do not typically leave visible markings on their target, and hits are not always apparent. Though the pellets can sometimes leave red contusions or "welts" on exposed skin, the game relies heavily on an honor system in which the person who has been hit is ethically responsible for calling themselves out.

The airsoft guns used are typically magazine-fed, with some having manual spring charged systems similar to Nerf Blasters, or powered by replaceable compressed gas (e.g. propane ("green gas"), 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or CO2) canisters, or are battery-powered.
Many airsoft guns also have mounting platforms compatible with genuine firearm accessories, and cosmetically more resembling to real guns. This makes them popular for military simulation and historical reenactments. 
There is also professional gun safety and weapon manipulation training conducted with airsoft in some fields, such as law enforcement, due to better safety and lower cost. The United States Coast Guard, for instance, has officially adopted airsoft for training in 2018.

Gameplay varies in style and composition, but often range from short-term skirmishes, organized scenarios, close quarters battle, field, military simulations (MilSim) or historical reenactments. They are played in indoor courses or outdoor fields. 
Combat situations on the battlefield may involve the use of military tactics to achieve objectives set in each game. Participants may attempt to emulate the tactical equipment and accessories used by modern military and police organizations. A game is normally kept safe by trained professionals.

Before gameplay, an airsoft gun's muzzle velocity is usually checked through a chronograph and usually measured in feet per second (FPS). Some countries have a set velocity or kinetic energy restriction; guns shooting over the legal velocity can be confiscated. Some playing fields further restrict projectile velocity.
